# Spam or Ham Classifier: Proof of Concept

## About the project
This project features a custom machine learning model designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). Serving as a proof of concept, it showcases the capability to train the model online, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving email patterns.

The classifier operates on a small-scale training dataset, yet mirrors the functionality of widely-used email providers such as Gmail and Yahoo. Through this project, explore the rudiments of email classification and delve into the potential of online learning in refining predictive accuracy over time.

5. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```
    cd ../backend
    ```

6. Set up the environment:
   - Create a virtual environment depending on your preference (e.g., using Anaconda).
   
7. Install backend dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

8. Apply migrations:
